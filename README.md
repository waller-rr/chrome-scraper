# Chrome-Scraper

Chrome-Scraper provides APIs to easily crawl the Chrome Extension or Theme for Python *without any external dependencies!*

## Related Projects
### [chrome-scraper](https://github.com/waller-rr/chrome-scraper)

I have referred a lot to the API design of this library.

## Installation
```
pip install chrome-scraper
```

## Usage
The country and language codes that can be included in the `lang` and `country` parameters described below depend on the [ISO 3166](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes) and [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) standards, respectively. Therefore, we recommend using an ISO database library such as [pycountry](https://github.com/flyingcircusio/pycountry).

### Chrome Detail
```python
from chrome_scraper import chrome

result = chrome(
    'doffdbedgdhbmffejikhlojkopaleian',
    lang='en', # defaults to 'en'
    country='us' # defaults to 'us'
)
```

Result of `print(result)`:

    "description": "This FREE and BEST ASO tool (App Store Optimization) provides the missing metrics of app marketing and keyword analysis for the Android Google Play.
It has 3 major features:
- Exposure of ASO performance
- App keyword checker
- Country switcher for different reports

üåü1. Exposure of ASO performanceüåü
We calculate the core metrics for evaluating app marketing performances (which are hidden by Google Play), including the exact number of app downloads and review changes over a month, the current version, and the publish date.
Valuable metrics such as the revenue, MAU, and all the trends alongside are also available on ASOTools.io (the website)!

üåü2. App keyword checker [Coming Soon]üåü
Not all keywords in use for an app are written within the \"description\" on the product page. We sort out the top 10 keywords for each app to show what's contributing most to an app's in-store search rank.
For each keyword, we attach the popularity, in-store search volume, difficulty, counts of related apps, and app's search rank as well.

üåü3. Country switcher for different reports [Coming Soon]üåü
ASO performance and keyword mapping of an App differentiate in different countries/regions.
You can easily switch from one country/region to another in the Play Store to gain customized reports.

For any question or suggestion, we are always here for listening! Try this extension out and make the App competition analysis easier than ever!

### App Reviews
`reviews` function returns `result` with `continuation token`.

- `result` : Crawling result of reviews. (list)
- `continuation_token` : Data containing how many items were loaded, what arguments used in the current result. If you pass this value to the `continuation_token` parameter of the `reviews` function, the next items are crawled. For example, if 1000 reviews are retrieved and the returned token 'eXamplE' is passed to the reviews function, the list of reviews is retrieved from 1000 or later items.

> :bulb: Setting `count` too high can cause problems. Because the maximum number of reviews per page supported by Google Play is 200, it is designed to pagination and recrawl by 200 until the number of results reaches count.

```python
from google_play_scraper import Sort, reviews

result, continuation_token = reviews(
    'com.fantome.penguinisle',
    lang='en', # defaults to 'en'
    country='us', # defaults to 'us'
    sort=Sort.NEWEST, # defaults to Sort.NEWEST
    count=3, # defaults to 100
    filter_score_with=5 # defaults to None(means all score)
)

# If you pass `continuation_token` as an argument to the reviews function at this point,
# it will crawl the items after 3 review items.

result, _ = reviews(
    'com.fantome.penguinisle',
    continuation_token=continuation_token # defaults to None(load from the beginning)
)
```

Result of `print(result)`:

### App All Reviews
`reviews_all` function returns all of reviews from app. If you want to set the count to infinity while using the `reviews` function, you can use the `reviews_all` function.

> :bulb: Because of the Google Play Store limit (up to 200 reviews can be fetched at a time), http requests are generated as long as the number of app reviews is divided by 200. For example, targeting an app like Pok√©mon GO makes tens of thousands of http requests.

```python
from google_play_scraper import Sort, reviews_all

result = reviews_all(
    'com.fantome.penguinisle',
    sleep_milliseconds=0, # defaults to 0
    lang='en', # defaults to 'en'
    country='us', # defaults to 'us'
    sort=Sort.MOST_RELEVANT, # defaults to Sort.MOST_RELEVANT
    filter_score_with=5 # defaults to None(means all score)
)
```


### App Permissions
`permissions` function returns permissions of app.

```python
from google_play_scraper import permissions

result = permissions(
    'com.spotify.music',
    lang='en', # defaults to 'en'
    country='us', # defaults to 'us'
)
